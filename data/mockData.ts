    question: "What does Newton's first law of motion state?",
    options: ['F=ma', 'For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction', 'An object at rest stays at rest', 'Energy cannot be created or destroyed'],
    correctAnswer: 'An object at rest stays at rest',
    explanation: "Newton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."

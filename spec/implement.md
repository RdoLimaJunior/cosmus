# Implementation Details: User Manual

This document records the implementation of the User Manual feature as per the specification.

## Summary of Changes

The feature was implemented by creating a new screen and its associated icon, adding internationalization strings, and integrating it into the application's routing and settings UI. The implementation adheres to the existing project structure and coding style, utilizing lazy loading for optimal performance.

## Files Created

1.  **`screens/UserManual.tsx`**: A new React component that renders the user manual page. It fetches translations using the `useAppContext` hook and provides navigation via `useNavigate`.

2.  **`components/icons/QuestionMarkCircleIcon.tsx`**: A new SVG icon component used to visually identify the user manual link and the manual page itself.

## Files Modified

1.  **`App.tsx`**: The main application router was updated to include a new lazy-loaded route:
    ```tsx
    const UserManual = lazy(() => import('./screens/UserManual'));
    ...
    <Route path="/manual" element={<UserManual />} />
    ```
    This route is nested within the `ProtectedRoute` to ensure it's only accessible to logged-in users.

2.  **`i18n/index.ts`**: The central translation file was updated with new keys under the `userManual` section for all three languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish). This ensures all text content is localized.

3.  **`screens/Settings.tsx`**: A new `<Link>` component was added to the "General" section, pointing to the `/manual` route.
    ```tsx
    <Link to="/manual" ... >
        <QuestionMarkCircleIcon ... />
        {t('navUserManual')}
    </Link>
    ```

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully delivered the User Manual feature according to the plan and specification. All acceptance criteria were met.
